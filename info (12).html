<br/>
<br/>
<li><p class="para">Hour of code is an activity in Code.org, which allows a great diversity of people throughout the world to attend. The Hour of Code started as a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify "code", to show that anybody can learn the basics, and to broaden participation in the field of computer science. It has since become a worldwide effort to celebrate computer science, starting with 1-hour coding activities but expanding to all sorts of community efforts. This grassroots campaign is supported by over 400 partners and 200,000 educators worldwide. Getting acquainted with coding from an early age is important in this age of technology. Hour of code is a very useful project encouraging students to code, to increase their interest and increase the number of future IT scientists. We chose school number 193 to participate in the Hourofcode event from our country. We will introduce coding to 5th grades at school by explaining them funny code.org assignments. First of all, we will inform them about our university. It is known that ADA University is the leading university in the field of IT in our country. Then we will show a presentation that will explain to them about the hourofcode event. We will practice the fun and equally instructive tasks of code.org, which we have chosen for them. We hope that this will attract the interest of children and arouse their interest in technology.</p></li>

<li><p class="para">What we have done so far:</p></li>
<li><p class="para">This project gave us the opportunity to experience the challenges of creating a website. The fact that the assignment is group work has made the process of creating a web site more fun and interesting. Being a group work has brought also many advantages, such as exchange of ideas among teammates, sharing our ideas, division of work, etc. From the logo of our website, to the colors we will use, we have gathered at the university and decided together everything. We are very pleased with what we have done and we hope you will like it.</p></li>
