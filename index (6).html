  <li><p class="para"><q>We are students of the SITE faculty of ADA University, 
    which gathered the team #9 for an ICT project. The name of our group comes from the recently coined term "Generation-Z" &#8211 abbreviated to <q>GenZ</q>. As our first project <q>Hour of Code</q> required, we had to target youngsters as our audience, so we decided to have another name for today's teens <q>GenC</q> that means <q>Generation&#8211Coding</q>. It also resonates with the word <q>g&#601;nc</q> in our language, meaning "a young person". We came up with this name as a symbol of living in the century of technology. In this era of rapid development of the IT industry, it would not be wrong to contribute ourselves to "generation-coding". Also, although we have no web development experience, we have created this beginner-friendly web page for our team projects. We hope this will inspire others. We wish everyone, regardless of age, to understand that coding is not difficult, but interesting and funny. We encourage everyone to try coding at least once in their life.</q>

    <li><p class="para1"><q>I was not the greatest fan of teamwork when there was a tight deadline and many other things to do along with your project. Well, this time because of how our team clicked I actually got to like team projects. At first we arranged a meeting to determine what we all are capable of. Then, we assigned the team leader and others' roles. My teammates were really helpful and motivating this whole time while I was trying to create a website. I pulled an all-nighter sometimes to not disappoint the beliefs they have put on me. I loved our efforts trying to make it look as professional as we can for a beginner team. I believe we'd go much further if we had a little more time or other projects together.</q></p></li>

<li><p class="para1"><q>It was great to participate in this assignment with my teammates. I am very pleased to have the experience of creating a web site with them. I learned HTML and CSS, the main markup languages of web development, as well as JavaScript programming language. It was enjoyable to explore the "mysterious" world behind the web sites we've been using, researching and playing games so far. We have taken our first steps in the web development part of IT, and I am very excited and proud to be given this opportunity to be encouraged by our supervisors.</q></p></li>

<li><p class="para1"><q>My main task during the development of the site was to find ways to make the site more interactive and attract the attention of visitors. On the other hand, I tried to take an active part in the development of the main HTML database of the site. During the creation of the site, I realized how useful team work is. It was really interesting and fun to do research and discuss together. It also shortens and simplifies the task. Thanks to the division of labor, each of us completed the work by fulfilling the tasks set before us.</q></p></li>

<li><p class="para1"><q>As i completed full course of CSS and HTML and practiced a lot using some additional videos and websites, I had a small experience which leaded me to producing a website with my teammates. Personally i very enjoyed in this process, because we had many opinions and I was the person which helped to make one decision. Moreover, i helped my teammate to create a full-fledged project in CSS part.</q></p></li>
